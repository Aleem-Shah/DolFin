    <h2 class="ins-h">Stocks Market</h2>
    <p class="ins-p">Investing in the stock market is an old speciality dating back to the 1600’s, when the first stock
        market was established in Amsterdam. The first in the United States was founded in 1791 at New York, and now it
        has become the biggest stock exchange in the world.

        After a brief history explanation, now let’s see what the stock market has become today. With three ways to
        invest, this market is becoming more popular as each day passes. The three ways of investing are:
        
        
    <ul class="pa-p">
        <li> Individual stocks - this first way of investing is the most time consuming way to do it, but if the time
            allows you, it is one of the best ways to become wealthier in a shorter period of time than the next
            approach..</li>
        <li> Index funds - the index funds are safer, less time consuming, but with a reduced return income than the
            individual stocks. Using both of these methods simultaneously can maintain stability in your investment
            account. </li>
        <li> Robo-advisors - this has become a popular way to invest, when your time is not permissive. Using an
            algorithm, this new type of brokerage calculates your age, risk tolerance, and investing goals in order to
            decide where and when to invest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="ins-h">Cryptocurrencies</h2>
    <p class="ins-p">Cryptocurrencies have been for the last few years a growing trend amongst investors and the younger public. The
        first crypto introduced was Bitcoin, in 2009. Since then, Bitcoin and thousands of other cryptos have increased
        their value considerably. In 2014, Bitcoin had its value at 400 USD, and now in the summer of 2022, it finds
        itself at 20 000 USD, after taking an enormous decrease since China banned crypto and with the invasion of
        Ukraine.<br>
        <br>

        But, despite the latest fall of Bitcoin, there are other 9000 cryptos on the market, the newest introduced
        rising as hours pass. So, when informing yourself about crypto, do not jump to conclusions that are only viable
        for a few tokens.
        Crypto is still a volatile market, not having constant stability and it is quite a risky way to invest a lot of
        capital in them. However, it is a good way to learn about them and to ‘play’ with a little extra money you have.
        <br>
        <br>
        Crypto and stocks have similarities in the process that you go to invest. The notorious brokers from Wall Street
        are named Cryptocurrency Exchange. Your portfolio is called Crypto wallet and so on. Differences between them
        include: the percentage that you return after cashing stocks, while on crypto this doesn’t exist, so all of your
        profit is not cut by taxes, you can also use crypto to purchase different goods, by transferring them to other
        users, and so on.

        Flipping houses
    </h2>
    <p class="ins-p">As well as crypto and stocks, flipping houses was and still is a trend amongst people that have savings and want
        to increase them. Buying and selling houses in the pandemic however, has been decreasing for these past two
        years and a half. People have been more careful with their spendings, and a big commitment like purchasing a
        house has not been on the top of the list for many people.
        <br>
        <br>
        Despite this, as the Covid-19 pandemic is starting to fade considerably in many countries, the right time for
        many new families to make a commitment has come. Some statistics foresee an increase in house purchases in the
        next 2 years.

    <h2 class="ins-h">US Recession</h2>
    <p class="ins-p">This title may have grasped your attention while scrolling through social media or when searching for a news post
        on television and so on. The US recession will take place, but not until the Fall of 2023, some experts say.
        But, before we dig into this subject, let’s look at what recession means.
        <br>
        <br>
        A recession is a significant, widespread, and prolonged downturn in economic activity. The causes of a recession
        are the lack of liquidity from a bank which leads to less loans and a higher interest rate. From this,
        businesses lending money will retain themselves from doing that. But without money, their operational funds will
        be limited and firing people will become a breath of air for most business owners.
        <br>
        <br>
        Contrary to how scary this sounds, a recession can not be predicted on how strong it will hit the economy. So,
        take a few steps in order to have a good-night sleep: try and find yourself a new job and set some cash aside.
        One last thing, do not let your emotions take over your thinking. Find a credible source of news and stay
        objective with every financial situation.
