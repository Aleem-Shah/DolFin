    <h1 class="macs">Economy</h1>
    <p class="mac">
        When we think about a local economy, we’re referring to the interconnected markets and networks within a
        particular community. The local government, organizations, businesses, and people all contribute to this
        economy. Local businesses may purchase their raw materials from sellers who are nearby. These sellers may get
        grants or tax relief from local councils or governments. People in the area pay taxes, work for businesses, and
        purchase goods and services.
<br><br><br>
        However, as countries, and eventually the entire world, became more accessible and connected, economic webs
        expanded to become ever more complex. Of course, local economies still exist; they’re just part of something
        larger. This is where national economies come into the limelight.
<br><br><br>
        According to the Bank of England, when we talk of a national economy, such as the UK economy, we’re referring to
        a system for distributing scarce resources. An economy, they suggest, is based on the fact that resources, such
        as workers, land, and raw materials, are limited. Demand, however, is infinite.
<br><br><br>
        Although this principle of distributing scarce resources is at the heart of any economy, national governments
        often have radically different approaches to how they mold and manufacture a nation’s economy. That’s why the US
        economy, for example, is very different from the Chinese economy.
<br><br><br>
        By the time we could move resources and products across borders, these national economies again became part of a
        much wider network of interconnected nations: the global economy.
<br><br><br>
        The world economy (also known as the global economy) refers to the economy of all humans in the world. This
        definition includes the various economic systems and activities that take place within and between nations.
<br><br><br>
        This broad scope captures the exchange of capital (money and assets) as well as the consumption and production
        of goods. Thanks to globalization, international trade, finance, and investment all help to power the world’s
        economy.
<br><br><br>
        How do economies organize themselves? ( heading)
        There are all kinds of different economic systems that local and national economies might adopt. What’s more,
        throughout history, we’ve seen various types of systems emerge, thrive, and decline. Most economies around the
        world today follow a capitalist system. One of the key characteristics of a capitalist economy is that private
        entities (as opposed to state-owned) control property and production in accord with their interests. In
        capitalism, supply and demand mean that market prices can be set to serve the interest of the wider society.
        Another stand-out feature of a capitalist economy is that there is a motivation to make a profit. Examples of
        capitalist economies include the US, UK, and Australia.
<br><br><br>
        While in capitalism, private companies own the means of production, in socialism, everything is owned by the
        state or the public. Rather than working for the profit of the individual, everyone works for wealth that is
        distributed among the people. Rather than supply and demand setting prices and the production of goods, in a
        socialist economy, products and services are produced based on usage value – the needs of society. Examples of
        socialist economies include North Korea and The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
<br><br><br>
        Much like socialism, a communist economy aims for ownership of the means of production by the community. It aims
        to create a classless society where everyone contributes and takes out according to their ability and needs.
        However, this often comes at the expense of individual freedoms. Examples of communist countries today include
        China, Cuba, and Vietnam.
<br><br><br>
        Although the different types of economic systems outlined above exist, it’s rarely as rigid as that. As we
        explore in our open step on different types of economies, the economy and markets are dependent on how they
        allocate the factors of production to control the economy.
<br><br><br>
        Markets are the mechanisms by which scarce resources are allocated. They ensure that consumers and producers can
        obtain the goods and services they want. When it comes to macroeconomics, the type of market a country has plays
        a big role in its economy.
<br><br><br><br><br>
        At one extreme, command markets exist where all the factors of production are controlled by the state. This
        means:
        <br>
        • What to produce is determined by government preferences
        <br>
        • How to produce is determined by the government and their employees
        <br>
        • For whom to produce is determined by government preferences
        <br>
        • Free markets
<br><br><br>
        At the other end of the spectrum are free-market economies. Rather than the government controlling decisions,
        the factors of production are decided by the consumer and producer and usually depend on money. This means:
        <br>
        • What to produce is determined by consumers’ preferences
        <br>
        • How to produce is determined by producers seeking profit
        <br>
        • For whom to produce is determined by purchasing power
<br><br><br><br><br>
        At the middle of the spectrum is a mixed market – a compromise between the other extremes. This means that there
        is some level of government intervention, usually setting boundaries in which the free market can operate. This
        means:
        <br>
        • What to produce is determined by consumers’ preferences and partly by the government.
        <br>
        • How to produce is determined by producers seeking profits and partly by the government.
        <br>
        • For whom to produce is determined by purchasing power and partly by government preferences.
<br><br><br>
        When thinking about the economy from an economics perspective, there are two sides to consider – macroeconomics
        and microeconomics. According to the IMF, macroeconomics focuses on the ‘big’ picture of the economy, such as
        the employment rate, gross domestic product (GDP), and inflation rates. These are the factors that a nation’s
        government creates fiscal policies about. Microeconomics looks at the more granular detail of an economy. They
        explore how households and businesses make financial decisions related to factors such as the impact of supply
        and demand on a market. Both micro and macro factors influence the way an economy works, showing just how much
        complexity there is in this area.
<br><br><br>
        some of the aspects that influence an economy include growth, unemployment rates, inflation, interest and
        exchange rates, and commodity (oil, steel, gold, etc) prices. These factors affect the income and purchasing
        power of households and organizations. When we measure the success of a national economy, we talk in terms of
        gross domestic product – the value of the country’s finished goods and services in a specific period.
<br><br><br>
        How economy can affect you?
        <br>
        • Living costs. The cost of living is tied closely to the economy. It’s defined as the amount of money needed to
        cover basic expenses such as food, housing, and taxes. This cost is measured by the inflation rate. As goods and
        services cost more, the power of a unit of currency lessens.
        <br>
        • Employment rates. A booming economy will also mean that rates of employment increase. As more goods and
        services (resources) are in demand, more people are needed to provide them, creating more jobs. The same is true
        of the opposite – when demand is low, there are fewer jobs available.
        <br>
        • Government spending. The performance of a country’s economy will impact the policies and spending of the
        government. As businesses make more money and pay more tax, there is improved cash flow, allowing the government
        to invest in infrastructure and services.
        <br>
        • Quality of life. As a country’s economy grows, there are more resources available to spend on sectors such as
        education and healthcare. What’s more, it means there are more jobs available, a reduction in poverty, and
        overall improved well-being for the people in that economy. At least, in theory.
        <br>
        • Again, this is a fairly simplified explanation of these points. In reality, there are many complexities and
        mechanisms that determine the economic impacts on individuals, organizations, and nations. It’s linked to the
        way societies grow and develop, and can be a force for change.
<br><br><br><br><br>
        “The economy is in constant evolution and the digital revolution of the past decades have inspired several
        companies to address various consumer needs and drive inclusion.”
<br><br><br>
        So how does an economy work? Well, it’s complicated. However, in essence, economies work by distributing scarce
        resources among individuals and entities. A series of markets where goods and services are exchanged,
        facilitated by capital, combine to make an economy. These networks exist at a local, national and international
        level.
