    <h1 class="macs"> Wealth Creation</h1>
    <p class="mac">
        Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many people across a wide swath of industries are currently without jobs and hence,
        a stable source of income. The side effect of these measures has been a major supply shock, as workers are
        forced to stay home and many businesses are temporarily shut down. At the same time, demand for many goods and
        services has plummeted, as households and companies are no longer able, either physically or financially, to
        maintain their spending. In this unprecedented situation, as countries grapple to minimise the impact of the
        lockdown on the livelihoods of their citizens, the usual trade-offs between support and incentives, and between
        generosity and fiscal sustainability, have been temporarily laid aside. Concerns about undermining incentives to
        work appear secondary as workers have been asked to stay at home; worries of fiscal sustainability have been put
        on pause as policymakers move fast in attempts to avert a deeper social and economic crisis. Although we can’t
        solve such problems without interventions from macro-economic institutions, we can certainly look for alternate
        sources of income to help ourselves as individuals.

       <b class="maz"> All you need to know about start-ups </b>
       <br>
        The term start-up refers to a company in the first stages of operations. Start-ups are founded by one or more
        entrepreneurs who want to develop a product or service for which they believe there is demand. These companies
        generally start with high costs and limited revenue, which is why they look for capital from a variety of
        sources such as venture capitalists.
        <br><br>
        The first step in starting a start-up is having a great idea. From there, market research is the next step to
        determine how feasible the idea is and what the current marketplace looks like for your idea. After the market
        research, creating a business plan that outlines your company structure, goals, mission, values, and objectives,
        is the next step.
<br><br>
        One of the most important steps is obtaining funding. This can come from savings, friends, family, investors, or
        a loan. After raising funding, make sure you've done all the correct legal and paperwork. This means registering
        your business and obtaining any required licenses or permits. After this, establish a business location. From
        there, create an advertising plan to attract customers, establish a customer base, and adapt as your business
        grows. A start-up can also obtain a loan from a bank, certain organizations, or friends and family.
<br><br>
        Starting a company can be a difficult but rewarding venture. Having a great idea and attempting to bring it to
        market comes with a host of challenges, such as attracting capital, employees, marketing, legal work, and
        managing finances. However, it is the most lucrative way of generating a perpetual cash flow for your bank
        account. Remember: high risk always correlates to high reward.
<br><br>
       <b class="maz"> Understanding freelancing</b>  
       <br> 
       A freelancer is an individual who earns money on a per-job or per-task basis, usually for short-term work as an
        independent contractor. A freelancer is not an employee of a firm and may therefore be at liberty to complete
        different jobs concurrently by various individuals or firms unless contractually committed to working
        exclusively until a particular project is completed.
<br><br>
        Typically, freelancers are considered independent workers and may do their contract work full time or as a side
        job to supplement full-time employment, time permitting. Freelancers, as independent contractors, typically
        require signed contracts for the job to be done and will agree to a predetermined fee based on the time and
        effort required to complete the task. This fee may be a flat fee or a per-hour, per-day, per-project fee, or
        some other similar measure.
<br><br>
        A freelancer tends to work in the creative, skilled, or service sector, such as in film, art, design, editing,
        copywriting, proofreading, media, marketing, music, acting, journalism, video editing and production,
        illustration, tourism, consulting, website development, computer programming, event planning, photography,
        language translation, tutoring, catering, and many more.
<br><br>
        Freelance jobs can be found via word of mouth, referrals, and networking, but they are also posted in various
        places online and in print. Online platforms like Upwork, LinkedIn, Craigslist, and Fiverr are popular venues
        for finding freelance work.
<br><br>
        While people often freelance as a side job or "gig," some people can turn freelancing into a full-time career.
        As a career, a freelancer must be skilled, motivated, and able to deal with volatile income flows.

        <b class="maz">What is passive income? </b>
        <br>
        Passive income is earnings derived from a rental property, limited partnership, or other enterprise in which a
        person is not actively involved. Proponents of earning passive income tend to be boosters of a work-from-home
        and be-your-own-boss professional lifestyle. Passive income has been a relatively loosely used term in recent
        years. Colloquially, it’s been used to define money being earned regularly with little or no effort on the part
        of the person receiving it. Examples include property rental (provided real estate isn’t your line of work),
        equipment leasing, and limited partnership interest.
<br><br>
         <b class="maz">Passive Income Ideas </b>
         <br>
       <b class="maz">  Giving Property on Rent</b>
       <br> 
       This is perhaps one of the most sought-after passive income sources, especially for those who own multiple
        properties. For instance, if you own two houses, you can put the unoccupied one on rent and earn. Your rental
        income can be substantial if you own a property in a prime location with good infrastructure and connectivity.
<br><br>
        If you put a commercial property on rent, it can fetch you a hefty sum of money as rent. Hence, before you buy a
        property, look at the rental aspect should you require it in the future. To earn a decent amount of rent,
        maintain the property well, and carry out the needed repairs on time. Utilize real estate portals to list your
        property for rent. You can give ads in local newspapers to attract potential tenants.
<br><br>
         
<b class="maz">Non-cumulative Fixed Deposits</b>
       <br>
         Non-cumulative fixed deposits can serve as a potent source of passive income. In such deposits, the financial
        institution, bank, or NBFC does not withhold the interest but pays it regularly. The interest paid is either
        monthly or quarterly. In a few cases, it is semi-annually.
<br><br>
        Unlike a cumulative fixed deposit, where you do not earn anything during the FD tenure, the case is different
        for a non-cumulative deposit. However, note that the interest in a non-cumulative deposit is slightly less than
        a cumulative one. Additionally, there is no option to reinvest in a non-cumulative deposit.
<br><br>
        Investing in such a deposit is simple and easy. Walk into the bank’s branch with which you have an account, fill
        up the deposit form, and you are done. You can also invest in a non-cumulative deposit with internet banking. On
        most occasions, you will get the deposit certificate on the same day.
<br><br>
        <b class="maz">Saving Account Offering a High-Interest Rate </b>
        <br>
        While interest rates on bank savings accounts have come down, some banks offer a higher interest rate.
        Additionally, some banks credit the interest on the money every month instead of every quarter. These
        high-interest savings accounts can serve as a good source of passive income.
<br><br>
        If you have low-risk tolerance and want assured income, you can invest in a high-yielding savings account.
        However, do your due diligence before investing. Also, note that interest income above INR 10,000 in a financial
        year is added to your income and taxed as per the applicable tax rates.
<br><br>
         <b class="maz">Peer-to-Peer Lending</b>
        <br>
         If you have money to lend, getting yourself listed on peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms can help build a
        prudent source of passive income. P2P lending platforms act as intermediaries between borrowers and lenders. You
        are connected with the potential borrower whose evaluation is done based on their credit score.
<br><br>
        You can decide the interest rate that you want to charge for lending. Once the formalities are done, you credit
        the money to the borrower’s account and upon EMI payment, you earn the interest. Most P2P platforms also assist
        you in recovery in the event of non-payment. However, to avoid non-repayments opt for listing yourself on P2P
        platforms with a solid risk assessment mechanism.
<br><br>
        <b class="maz">Influencer and content creation </b>
       <br>
        If you are someone with many followers on social media, you can become an influencer and earn a handsome amount.
        The rise of the gig economy has fuelled in the past few years means you can turn your passion into income. All
        you need to do is look out for opportunities in your domain and lap them instantly.
