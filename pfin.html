    <h1 class="macs">Financial literacy</h1>
    <p class="mac">The earlier you learn the basics of how money works, the more confident and successful you’ll be with
        your finances later in life. It’s never too late to start learning, but it pays to have a head start. The first
        steps into the world of money start with education. Banking, budgeting, saving, credit, debt, and investing are
        the pillars that underpin most of the financial decisions that we’ll make in our lives.
        <br><br>

        Covid-19 has proved that we need to be aware of our financial well-being to thwart the impact of such a crisis
        from affecting us and our loved ones. Life after Corona reminds us that health and wealth are the two assets
        that need to be safeguarded at all costs.
<br><br>
        Financial literacy is the ability to understand and make use of a variety of financial skills. It also means
        comprehending certain financial principles and concepts, such as the time value of money, compound interest,
        managing debt, and financial planning. Achieving financial literacy can help individuals avoid making poor
        financial decisions and help them become self-sufficient and achieve financial stability. Key steps to attaining
        financial literacy include learning how to create a budget, track spending, pay off debt, and plan for
        retirement. Educating yourself on these topics also involves learning how money works, setting and achieving
        financial goals, becoming aware of unethical/discriminatory financial practices, and managing financial
        challenges that life throws your way.
<br><br>
        Personal finance is where financial literacy translates into individual financial decision-making. Personal
        finance is about making and meeting your financial goals—whether owning a home, helping other members of your
        family, saving for your children’s college education, supporting causes that you care about, planning for
        retirement, or anything else.
<br><br>
        <b class="maz">  A quick glance at two important financial instruments:</b>
        <br><br>

        Bank accounts 
        <br><br>
        Keeping money in a bank account is usually safer than holding cash. Assets held in a bank are harder to steal;
        further, it is the most liquid medium in which your currency can be stored. Many financial transactions require
        you to have a bank account to:
        <br><br>

        • Use a debit or credit card
        <br>
        • Use payment apps like PayPal
        <br>
        • Write a check
        <br>
        • Use an ATM
        <br>
        • Buy or rent a home
        <br>
        • Receive your paycheck from your employer
        <br>
        • Earn interest on your money
<br><br>
        <b class="-`">Why an emergency fund is important for everyone?</b> 
        <br>
        An emergency fund is not a specific type of bank account but can be any source of cash that you’ve saved to help
        you handle financial hardships like job losses, medical bills, or car repairs. How they work:
        <br>
        • Most people use a separate savings account.
       <br>
        • The account should total enough to cover three to six months’ worth of expenses.
        <br>
        • Emergency fund money should be off-limits for paying regular expenses.
<br><br>
        <b class="maz">Credit cards</b> 
        <br>
        Credit cards are accounts that let you borrow money from the credit card issuer and pay it back over time. For
        every month when you don’t pay back the money in full, you’ll be charged interest on your remaining balance.
        Debit cards take money directly out of your checking account, whereas credit cards allow you to borrow money and
        do not pull cash from your bank account. Using a credit card judiciously and paying your credit card bills on
        time helps you establish a credit history and a good credit rating. It’s important to build a good credit rating
        not only to qualify for the best credit cards but also because you will get more favourable interest rates on
        car loans, personal loans, and mortgages. APR (annual percentage rate) is the amount of interest that you’ll owe
        the credit card issuer on any unpaid balance.
<br><br>
        <b class="maz">How to create a budget? </b>
        <br> 
        Creating a budget is one of the simplest and most effective ways to control your spending, saving, and
        investing. One budget template that helps individuals reach their goals, manage their money, and save for
        emergencies and retirement is the 50/20/30 budget rule: spending 50% on needs, 20% on savings, and 30% on wants.
<br><br>
        Budgeting starts with tracking how much money you receive every month (total income), minus how much money you
        spend every month (total expenses). If you can’t remember where you’re spending money, review your bank
        statements, credit card statements, and brokerage account statements. Fixed expenses are the purchases that you
        must make every month. Their amounts don’t change (or change very little) and are considered essential. They
        include rent/mortgage payments, loan payments, and utilities. Discretionary spending is the category for
        nonessential or varying purchases for things like restaurant meals, shopping, clothes, and travel. Consider them
        wants rather than needs. Record the amount of money that you’re able to save each month, whether it’s in cash,
        cash deposited into a bank account, or money that you add to an investment account or retirement account.
<br><br>
        Now that you have a clear picture of money coming in, money going out, and money saved, you can identify which
        expenses you can cut back on if necessary. put your extra money into an emergency fund until you’ve saved three
        to six months’ worth of expenses in case of a job loss or other emergency.
<br><br>
        <b> Are banks safe?</b> 
        The answer can vary from country to country. For example, in the US, most bank accounts are insured by the
        Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to certain limits, currently defined as “up to at least $250,000
        per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category,” whereas in countries like India, all deposits are
        insured but not for the entire amount. If a bank fails, a depositor (irrespective of the number of deposits) can
        get up to Rs 1 lakh from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), a wholly-owned
        subsidiary of the RBI.
<br><br>
         (<b class="maz">What is inflation?</b>
        Inflation is a rise in prices, which can be translated as the decline of purchasing power over time. Inflation
        is a rise in prices, which can be translated as the decline of purchasing power over time. Prices rise means
        that one unit of money buys fewer goods and services. This loss of purchasing power impacts the cost of living
        for the common public which ultimately leads to a deceleration in economic growth. The consensus view among
        economists is that sustained inflation occurs when a nation's money supply growth outpaces economic growth.
        Therefore, it is necessary to invest your money in inflation-beating assets so that your money technically
        retains its purchasing power as it yields returns. In simple terms:
<br><br>
        Rate of return of an asset - inflation rate = your actual yield rate. (put it in a different font or highlight
        it because it is important)
<br><br>
        If the yield rate is positive, then you will be making a profit in the long run after adjusting for inflation.
        If not, then you are making a loss.
