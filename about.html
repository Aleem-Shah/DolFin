    <h1 class="mc-r"> What do we do? </h1>
    <p class="mac">EduFin is an educational platform aimed at spreading awareness and equipping citizens all around the world to
        adapt to the ever changing work lifestyle in a post pandemic world. We help people to manage their income,
        create valuable assets and learn how the economy works</p>
    <h1>

        <h1 class="mc-r">Our mission </h1>
       <p class="mac"> The economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have not fallen with equal severity on all shoulders.
        Existing vulnerabilities have been exposed, and inequalities entrenched. Many of those with more limited means
        and protection, such as workers in informal employment or in diverse work arrangements, have been the least able
        to face the consequences of the crisis. There is a need for a platform which can help such masses to educate
        themselves on how to multiply their sources of income and attain financial stability. As we reel under the
        after-effects of the pandemic as a global community, financial literacy and well-being has become more important
        than ever. Our initiative is positioned at contributing our bit to fulfilling this noble cause.
       </p class="mac">
        <h1 class="mc-r">Our inspiration </h1>
        <p class="mac">During YYGS Online, students join simulations, where they address real-world issues by participating in an
        open-ended problem-solving activity with likeminded peers. This year, YYGS students are addressing global issues
        related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are inspired by YYGS's commitment to encourage its scholars to be the
        change that they want to see in the world. We undertake this initiative to respect and revere the spirit of
        YYGS.
